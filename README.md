<h2>Experience the world through the eyes of a child with autism. Learn about their challenges through exploration and puzzle solving. Understand their emotions and resolve conflicts. Welcome to Aiden's World. </h2>

<p>
  This project has been designed by a team of programmers and designers with the aim of creating an experience in which anyone can put themselves in the shoes of people who face complications in their daily lives due to the difficulties presented by autism.</p>

<p>For my part, in addition to including some game mechanics such as interaction with objects and the use of pressure plates, I was responsible for creating the menus so that they can be navigated using both keyboard/mouse and gamepad. Here is an example with the game's Main Menu.
